## **Work Experience**

### **Accenture**
**Designation**: Machine Learning Engineer  
**From**: June 2021 - **Till**: Present  

**Project**: **ATCI Data & AI Studio**
- **@ProjectDescription**: 
  - Developed a procedure to transform the existing content of an enterprise-level website into an indexed vector database, creating a knowledge base for a RAG-enabled chatbot which served as a quick search tool and cut down search time for users by 15%, significantly boosting user retention
  - Designed and implemented a content approval system for a pharmaceutical client, enabling regulatory and legal approvers to evaluate and approve campaign content being published on the website. Reducing approval time per page from 4 hours to 2.5 hours which was directly responsible for the decrease in go-live time and marketing campaigns.
  - Collaborated with over 12 projects to create standardized runbooks for the induction of generative AI tools, significantly enhancing work efficiency while ensuring data integrity and compliance.
  - Deployed generative AI POCs in working with large language models such as Llama-2/3, Mistral and GPT-3.5/4 augmenting with Vector Database with frameworks like LangChain and StreamLit with agentic architecture

**Project**: **Roche Diagnostics**
- **@ProjectDescription**:
  - Analyzed and revamped the existing application to identify system bottlenecks to identify changes that would yield maximum improvement. This led to increased page performance and quality score (Lighthouse) by 135% and 30% tech debt reduction.
  -Migrated rich media hosting from Dynamic Media Classic to Scene7 to enhance media processing capabilities, accelerated image loading, and minimized dependency on device-specific image renditions, resulting in a 50% drop in the size of media-heavy pages.
  - Created server cleanup utility responsible for clearing servers for long dormant pages and media to save space and keep servers lightweight, leading to a 15% server bloat reduction.
  - Created an ITSM management framework, revamping ITSM handling procedures across the project, resulting in a 60% drop in incident/service request response time and over 90% drop in active incidents/tickets.
